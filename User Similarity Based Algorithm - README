Collaborative Filtering: User Similarity Based Algorithm



Finding the predictions for movies ratings by users. Data set has 100000 records of which 80,000 are train records and
rest test records. 

Algorithm should be implemented to first, find the similarities between the users. Secondly, we find the predictions of the 
ratings of the items in the test using all the observed ratings (ratings from training set). 
As a last step, we find the mean actual error of the values between the predicted values and test records.


First part of the program was implemented, i.e., finding the user similarities in Python (by Douglas Lewit, Northeastern Illinois),
and the rest of the part was coded in Java (by Sunil Dokuru, Northeastern illinois).

I have implemented calculating the  user Similarity matrix part in Java. You can find it in the root with the name movieRecommendations.java

Java collections, HashMaps, ArrayLists, and arrays were used to code the project in Java.
Dictionary was used to map the user ratings to the items, as a part of finding user similarities in Python.
