KNN Clustering algorithm


Tasks involved: Implementing the k-NN algorithm, using Euclidean distance, majority voting scheme and distance - weighted voting scheme.

Data for the files used in the program ,Glass Identification Data Set can be seen in: glass.txt file in root folder.

Code is implemented to randomly pick up 75% of the records as the training set and use the rest of them as the test set.
Made sure that in test set, I have records that are from different classes.

Last column in the data set represents the class field.
Tested the program with different values of k (k= {1, 5, 10}) on the generated training set and test set.
Recorded the classification accuracies. Used, number of correctly classified records in test set to the number of 
total records in test set as the accuracy percentage.

Implemented k-NN algorithm above, using Euclidean distanceand the distance-weighted voting scheme.
