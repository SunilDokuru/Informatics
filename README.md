Data Mining Algorithms in java

As a part of my curriculum at Northeastern Illinois University course code CS419, I am exposed to data mining techniques.
This section contains the assignments given and delivered as a part of this course work.

Program implementations in: Clustering algorithms (KNN algorithm), and User Similarity Based Algorithms were coded. Here I place my work on these algorithms.

If you want to replicate my code feel free to do so.

Thanks,
Sunil Dokuru
